# N Queen Visualization  
  
### Problem Statement  
  
Place N (N = 4 or 8) queens in a chess board of size N X N, in a such a way that no two queens can attack each other.
  
That means  
  
- Two queens should not be in the same row  
- Two queens should not be in the same column  
- Two queens should not be in the same diagonal  
  
### Solution  
  
This is a visualization of the N Queen problem made with react. Using *backtracking* and *dynamic programming*. observe how we reach to the solution by placing the queens strategically to find the answer in the most optimize way.
  
- **Time Complexity** : O(N<sup>2</sup>)
- **Space Complexity** : O(N<sup>2</sup>)
